# Flight-Strikes-Analysis - I

Based on an inconsiderate attempt to understand the loss in the airplane industry, I designed this project on Tableau. 

Data Processing was done in Excel and imported to Tableau for some sleek and powerful dashboard presets.

Various birds keep getting in the flight path and ruin flying experience for the pilots and cause collateral damage to airline companies. 
Cleaning up the carcass also inretupts with airline operations at the ATC level. All this is super annoying if you know that its caused by something thats a metre width and 10 cms height. 

If we disect the statistics of impact just like how the wildlife gets squashed after getting in the way, we get to analyse the top affected airports, average cost of damage by each specie, number of strikes over time, and type of flight damage. 

As an analyst, it is great to see datasets that branch large under multiple categories. One of such is this dataset, niche but vast.
Due to the country commercializing everything, which is great for analysts like me, we have data exclusively to get the damage analysis.

If I am bored of thinking ideas for more git repos, I will complete writing this analysis. For now this is all you get.

The display is quite off as I tried embedding Tableau dashboard in this repo, you will not find anything but the poorly presented, smartly designed dashboard. I will copy paste this exact words if I face the same issue with Flight Strike Analysis - II repo.
